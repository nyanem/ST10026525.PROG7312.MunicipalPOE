## Project Overview

The Municipal Application is a web-based system designed to manage local municipal services, announcements, events, reports, and service requests.
The application demonstrates manual implementation of advanced data structures for educational purposes, without relying on  repositories or databases.

The application is built using ASP.NET Core MVC, and all data is stored in-memory for simplicity and reliability. The project is organized into three main tasks:

1. Reports Management

2. Events & Announcements Management

3. Service Requests Management

## Features 
### Task 1 - Report
- Submit reports regarding municipal issues (e.g., roads, electricity, sanitation).

- Categories managed using a HashSet for uniqueness.

- Reports automatically assigned IDs and timestamps.

- View all submitted reports.

### Task 2 - Events & Announcements 

- Add and display events in a SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<Event>>.

- Upcoming events managed with a Queue.

- Categories stored in a HashSet.

- Search and filter events by title, description, category, or date.

- Recommendations generated based on previous searches.

  ### Task 3 - Service Request Feature.
- Submit service requests (e.g., water issues, streetlights, or sanitation problems).
  
- Requests managed using an AVL Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient organization and retrieval.
  
- Requests can be viewed, searched, and tracked.

  ## Updates from Part 1 + 2

  - Removed database to prevent app crashes
  - removed login feature to reduce complication
  - implemented manual data structures.
  - Added services folder, where the data structures for Reports and Events are stored
  - Cleaned up Controllers
  - Removed any code generated by AI.
